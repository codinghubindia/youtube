   - The video player with educational content
   - The AI-powered sidebar with summaries and notes

2. **learning-dashboard.png** - A screenshot of the Learning Dashboard showing:
   - Stats cards (videos watched, minutes learned, etc.)
   - The "How It Works" section
   - Your learning progress with interests
   - Featured short videos section

3. **learning-mode-architecture.png** - A diagram showing:
   - The data flow between components
   - API integration (YouTube API and Gemini API)
   - Fallback mechanisms

## How to Create These Assets

### Screenshots
1. Run the application locally
2. Navigate to the relevant pages 
3. Use your system's screenshot tool (Win+Shift+S on Windows, Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac)
4. Crop and save in this directory with the exact filenames listed above

### Architecture Diagram
You can create this using tools like:
- [draw.io](https://draw.io) (free online diagram tool)
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (great for hand-drawn style)

## Tips for Great Presentation Assets

1. **Consistency**: Use the same resolution and aspect ratio for all screenshots
2. **Dark Mode**: Consider using dark mode for more visual appeal
3. **Real Data**: Show the app with real educational videos and progress data
4. **Annotations**: Add numbered callouts to highlight key features
5. **Branding**: Include any project branding/logo in diagrams

## For the Hackathon Submission

These assets will be critical for your hackathon submission, as they will:
1. Make your README more visually engaging
2. Show judges the functionality without needing to run the code
3. Demonstrate your attention to detail and UX design
4. Help explain complex technical concepts through visuals

Place all files in this directory and reference them in your README.md using relative paths.
